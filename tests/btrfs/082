# FS QA Test No. btrfs/082
#
# Regression test for a btrfs issue of resizing 'thread_pool' when
# remount the fs.
#
# This regression was introduced by the following linux kernel commit:
#     btrfs: Added btrfs_workqueue_struct implemented ordered
#     execution based on kernel workqueue
#     08a9ff3264181986d1d692a4e6fce3669700c9f8
# And it was fixed by the following linux kernel commit:
#     btrfs: fix crash in remount(thread_pool=) case
#     800ee2247f483b6d05ed47ef3bbc90b56451746c
