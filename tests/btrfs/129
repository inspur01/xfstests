# Test that an incremental send operation does not prematurely issues rmdir
# operations under a particular scenario (the rmdir operation is sent before

# issued (the rename for inode 260 must happen before the rename for inode 258).
# Then immediately after issuing the rename operation for inode 258, and before
# inode 261 was processed, the send stream issued a rmdir operation for inode
# 260, which would make the receiver fail with the error ENOTEMPTY because inode
# 261 was not yet renamed, it was still a child of inode 260 at that time.
