# FS QA Test 002
#
# Test that calling fsync against a file using the merged directory does not
# result in a crash nor fails unexpectedly.
#
# This is motivated by a change in overlayfs that resulted in a crash (invalid
# memory access) when the lower or upper directory belonged to a btrfs file
# system.
