# FS QA Test No. 039
#
# This test is motivated by an fsync issue discovered in btrfs.
# The issue was that after fsyncing an inode that got its link count
# decremented, and the new link count is greater than zero, after the
# fsync log replay the inode's parent directory metadata became
# inconsistent - it had a wrong i_size and dangling index entries which
# prevented the directory from ever being removed (rmdir always failed
# with -ENOTEMPTY, even if the directory had no more child inodes).
#
# The btrfs issue was fixed by the following linux kernel patch:
#
#    Btrfs: fix directory inconsistency after fsync log replay

# Remove the last hard link of the file and attempt to remove its parent
# directory - this failed in btrfs because the fsync log and replay code
# didn't decrement the parent directory's i_size and left dangling directory
# index entries - this made the btrfs rmdir implementation always fail with
# the error -ENOTEMPTY.
#
# The dangling directory index entries were visible to user space, but it was
# impossible to do anything on them (unlink, open, read, write, stat, etc)
# because the inode they pointed to did not exist anymore.
#
# The parent directory's metadata inconsistency (stale index entries) was
# also detected by btrfs' fsck tool, which is run automatically by the fstests
# framework when the test finishes. The error message reported by fsck was:
#
# root 5 inode 259 errors 2001, no inode item, link count wrong
#   unresolved ref dir 258 index 3 namelen 3 name bar filetype 1 errors 4, no inode ref
