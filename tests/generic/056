# FS QA Test No. 056
#
# This test is motivated by an fsync issue discovered in btrfs.
# The issue was that we could lose file data, that was previously fsync'ed
# successfully, if we end up adding a hard link to our inode and then persist
# the fsync log later via an fsync of other inode for example.
#
# The btrfs issue was fixed by the following linux kernel patch:
#
#  Btrfs: fix fsync data loss after adding hard link to inode
