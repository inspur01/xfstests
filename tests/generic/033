# FS QA Test No. 033
#
# This test stresses indirect block reservation for delayed allocation extents.
# XFS reserves extra blocks for deferred allocation of delalloc extents. These
# reserved blocks can be divided among more extents than anticipated if the
# original extent for which the blocks were reserved is split into multiple
# delalloc extents. If this scenario repeats, eventually some extents are left
# without any indirect block reservation whatsoever. This leads to assert
# failures and possibly other problems in XFS.
