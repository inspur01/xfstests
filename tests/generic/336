# FSQA Test No. 336
#
# Test that if we have a file F1 with two links, one in a directory A and the
# other in directory B, if we remove the link in directory B, move some other
# file F2 from directory B into directory C, fsync inode F1, power fail and
# remount the filesystem, file F2 exists and is located only in directory C.
