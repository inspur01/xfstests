# FS QA Test 353
#
# Check if fiemap ioctl returns correct SHARED flag on reflinked file
# before and after sync the fs
#
# Btrfs has a bug in checking shared extent, which can only handle metadata
# already committed to disk, but not delayed extent tree modification.
# This caused SHARED flag only occurs after sync.
