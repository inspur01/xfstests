# FS QA Test No. 002
#
# Test that after syncing the filesystem, adding many xattrs to a file, syncing
# the filesystem again, writing to the file and then doing a fsync against that
# file, all the xattrs still exists after a power failure. That is, after the
# fsync log/journal is replayed, the xattrs still exist and with the correct
# values.
#
# This test is motivated by a bug found in btrfs.

# less than 1000 xattrs with very small values.
